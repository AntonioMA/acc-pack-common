# SDK Wrapper and Common Accelerator Pack<br/>

The Wrapper is a library which makes it easier to use the OpenTok API for different platforms. 
The Wrapper includes the audio-video communication logic, the signaling flows and some advanced features of the SDK, like video quality warnings, reconnection,...etc

The Wrapper is required whenever you use any of the OpenTok accelerators for Android. It is optional for the iOS and Web accelerators pack.
